# KindoProject

It is an app where I have mainly focused on animations in android. There are two activities. 

In first activity a pair of blinking eyes shine up in darkness and a few seconds later three options pop up. If correct option is selected then the whole image of the animal comes forward.

In the second activity there is animation of rainfall. After a few seconds rainfall stops and the sun shines.
